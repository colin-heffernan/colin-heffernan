# About Me

Hi! I'm Colin. I like coding. I'm particularly interested in the following languages:
- Haskell
- TypeScript
- Nix


# Projects

I work on lots of personal projects right now, though I take interest in some bigger projects too, such as Nixpkgs/NixOS and Neovim.
I'm currently working on a fetch program written in Haskell!
