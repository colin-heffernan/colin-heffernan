# About Me

Hi! I'm Colin. I like making things, whether that's code, computers, music, or key lime pie.

## Interests:

- NixOS, considering I use it and all
- Svelte, my current go-to for web development
- C, C++, Go, Rust, and Haskell, all for TUI apps
- Music theory

## Projects (either planned or ongoing):

- Pulsar Chat, a WebSockets-based chat platform
  - I've technically already made this, but the backend host went down
- Typewriter, a text editor
  - Hopefully modal, and hopefully in a language I've never written before
- Legato, a client for MPD
  - Probably in Go or Rust, depending on which I decide to figure out first
