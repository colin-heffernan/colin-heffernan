# Hi! I'm Colin. I make things.

Sometimes it's software or hardware, occasionally it's music, and every now and again, it's a really good key lime pie.

## Interests

- The Nix ecosystem, which I interact with on a daily basis
- Rust, which is my current go-to language for projects
- Music theory, a lifelong interest I've finally decided to pursue

## Projects

### Ongoing

- [Reflex](https://github.com/colin-heffernan/reflex/), a text editor implemented in Rust
  - Trying to take the best of Neovim, Helix, and other editors

### Planned

- Pulsar Chat, a WebSockets-based chat platform
  - I've technically already made this, but the backend host went down
- Legato, a client for MPD
  - Probably in Go or Rust, depending on which I decide to figure out first
- Cosmos, a Lua-controlled GUI
  - Heavily inspired by GNU Emacs, but hopefully with saner defaults
