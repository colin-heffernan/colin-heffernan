# About Me

Hi! I'm Colin. I like coding. I'm particularly interested in the following languages:
- Nix
- Svelte
- Rust
- Haskell


# Projects

I work on lots of personal projects right now, though I take interest in some bigger projects too, such as Nixpkgs/NixOS and Helix.
I'm currently working on a chat platform built with SvelteKit and Supabase!
